# Wisboo-challenge

## As a challenge, I had to "give life" to a design previously provided by Wisboo.
 
### Developed a UI, regarding an academy: 
- What they earned during a certain period of time. 
- The information about some sales they made.
- You can register a sale (eventually If given the functionality).
- You can export some information you want (eventually If given the functionality).

### Tools:
- Pug, a HTML preprocessor.
- SCSS, a CSS preprocessor.
- Wisboo's library icons.

## Running the project:
- Clone the repository.
- Go live with Live Server extension (right click in "index.html" and click on "Open with Live Server", since the .pug file won't cut it).
